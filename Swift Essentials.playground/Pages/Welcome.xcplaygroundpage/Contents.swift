 # Welcome to Swift Essentials
 ### Learn Swift 3.1 using Xcode Playgrounds
 
 Throughout this course you will learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Swift.
 
 Swift is friendly to new programmers by supporting playgrounds, an innovative feature that allows programmers to experiment with Swift code and see the results immediately, without the overhead of building and running an app.
 
 Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun!
 
 This playground is structured with sessions and exercises designed to teach you to code using the Swift language.
 
 Tradition suggests that the first program in a new language should print the words “Hello, world!” on the screen. In Swift, this can be done in a single line:
 
 */
print("Hello, world!")  // Change 'world' to your name
//: [Let's Get Started](@next)
