 # Swift Essentials
 ## 8. Exercises
 
 The following exercises cover the concepts learnt in the previous sections.
 
 - callout(Exercise 1):
 Declare an array using an array literal that contains the names of six suburbs.\
 Print the 4th suburb.
 
 ````
 The 4th suburb in the array is Oatley
 ````
 
 - - -
 */
var suburbs = ["Bankstown", "Chatswood", "Liverpool", "Oatley", "Newtown", "Parramatta"]
print("The 4th suburb in the array is \(suburbs[3])")
/*:

 - note:
 Remember arrays are zero-indexed ðŸ˜‰

 - callout(Exercise 2):
 Replace the third suburb with a new suburb.\
 Add a new suburb to the array.\
 Print the number of suburbs in the array.
 
 
 ````
 The suburbs array now contains 7 items
 ````

 */
suburbs[2] = "Frenchs Forest"
suburbs.append("Sylvania")
print(suburbs.count)

 - callout(Exercise 3):
 Insert a new suburb into the array at index `2`.\
 Remove the suburb at index `4` and print the name of that suburb.\
 Remove the last suburb and also print its name.
 
 
 ````
 Oatley was removed at index 4
 Sylvania was removed from the last position
 ````

suburbs.insert("Haymarket", at: 2)
print("\(suburbs.remove(at: 4)) was removed at index 4")
print("\(suburbs.removeLast()) was removed from the last position")

 - callout(Exercise 4 - CHALLENGE):
 See if you can create an array of arrays ðŸ˜Ž\
 \
 One array that contains nine seperate `Character` arrays as follows:\
 \
 `["A", "B", "C"]`\
 `["D", "E", "F"]`\
 `["G", "H", "I"]`\
 `["J", "K", "L"]`\
 `["M", "N", "O"]`\
 `["P", "Q", "R"]`\
 `["S", "T", "U"]`\
 `["V", "W", "X"]`\
 `["Y", "Z"]`\
 \
 Then get the individual `Character`'s from the outer array to spell `SWIFT` and store them in another array:\
 \
 `["S", "W", "I", "F", "T"]`\
 \
 Now print "SWIFT".
 
 ````

 - note:
 A `String` can be initialised from a `[Character]`\
 \
 `let someString = String([charArray])`

 - callout(Exercise 5):
 Declare a dictionary using a dictionary literal that stores the Blackjack value of the `13` face cards in a deck.\
 \
 Use a `String` of the face name (`"Ace"`, `"Two"`, `"Three"`, ... `"King"`) as the *key*,\
 and an `Int` for the *value*.
